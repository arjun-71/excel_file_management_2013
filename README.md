1. Introduction:
The Excel File Management System is a software tool designed to provide users with the ability to efficiently manage Excel files through a command-line interface. The system offers features for reading, writing, and modifying Excel files, making it a valuable tool for users who frequently work with Excel spreadsheets.

2. Objectives:
- Develop a Python-based command-line application.
- Provide functionalities to read data from Excel files.
- Enable users to write data to new or existing Excel files.
- Allow users to modify existing Excel files by adding, updating, or deleting data.
- Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for ease of interaction.

3. Features.
- Read Excel Files: Extract data from Excel spreadsheets effortlessly.
- Write Excel Files: Create new Excel files or append data to existing ones.
- Modify Excel Files: Update, delete, or add new data to Excel spreadsheets seamlessly.
-Command-Line Interface (CLI): Enjoy a user-friendly CLI for easy interaction with the application.

4. Deliverables:
- Command-line application executable.
- Source code repository hosted on GitHub.
- Documentation including README, installation instructions, and usage guide.
- License file (MIT License).

5. Scope:
- The system will support Excel files in the `.xlsx` format.
- Reading and writing functionalities will handle basic data types such as text, numbers, and dates.
- Modification functionalities will include adding, updating, and deleting rows and columns.
- The CLI will provide clear and concise prompts for user input and feedback.
- Error handling mechanisms will be implemented to handle invalid inputs and file operations.

6. Assumptions:
- Users are familiar with basic command-line navigation and operations.
- Excel files used with the system adhere to the supported file format (.xlsx).
- The system will be developed using Python and will utilize appropriate libraries for Excel file manipulation (e.g., `openpyxl`).

7. Constraints:
- The system will be limited to Excel file management and will not include advanced data analysis or visualization features.
- Compatibility with older Excel file formats (e.g., `.xls`) will not be supported.
- Performance may vary depending on the size and complexity of Excel files being processed.
